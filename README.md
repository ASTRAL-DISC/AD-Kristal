# AD-Kristal (Kristal Fork)

This is a fork of the Kristal Engine made for the ASTRAL DISC project.

## Launching Kristal via .bat file

This repository includes a custom shell script named ``start.bat.`` The purpose of this script is to automatically merge updates from the original Kristal repository. Every time you launch Kristal-AD, we recommend you do so using this file.

```bash
@echo off
git fetch upstream main
git merge --no-ff upstream/main
pause
"C:\Program Files\LOVE/lovec" .
```

Additionally, if you're using Git to download Kristal updates, you can add a ``git pull`` line after the pause line in your ``.bat``, which will make Kristal-AD automatically update every time you launch it through the ``.bat`` file.

When you first clone this repository, you'll also need to run this git command to be able to access the most up to date commits:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal.git
```

## Clone the Chapters

To run the ASTRAL DISC Chapters, you'll need to download a few mods and place them in the following directory:
`C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\ad\mods`

You can quickly access the `AppData` folder by pressing `Win + R`, execute the `%appdata%` command, and navigate to the `LOVE` folder. Inside it, you'll find the `ad` folder, where you should add these mods:

- [Mod Loader](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/astraldisc)
- [Chapter 3](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter3)
- [Chapter 4](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter4)
- [Chapter 5](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter5)
- [Chapter 6](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter6)
- [Chapter 7](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter7)

### Note for the development team:

It's recommended to clone the repository instead of manually downloading the mods. This way, you can easily update your local copy by running `git pull` whenever updates are made. This ensures you're always working with the latest changes.

> **Reminder:** You need to execute the `.bat` file at least once for the `ad` folder to be created.
