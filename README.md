# AD-Kristal (Kristal Fork)

This is a customized fork of the [Kristal Engine](https://github.com/KristalTeam/Kristal), specifically for use with the [ASTRAL DISC](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC) chapters.

## Setup 

The first step is to clone this repository. 

There are multiple ways of doing it, but a quick one is to open up a terminal (PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc) and paste this command: 
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/AD-Kristal.git"
```

After cloning is done, you can launch the custom client through the next step below.

### Launching AD-Kristal via .bat file

This repository includes a [custom shell script](./start.bat) named ``start.bat``. The purpose of this script is to facilitate the process of starting the application. Every time you launch AD-Kristal, we recommend you do so using this file.

> [!NOTE]
> You need to have `.Git` installed in order to run the `.bat` file properly.

When executed, the script opens a console window and soon launches the custom client. Because this is your first time, there are no mods loaded, so an error will occur. Don't worry, this is expected. The client will still run some code and generate the necessary folders for the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> Additionally, you can add a `git pull` command in your `.bat` file. This will ensure AD-Kristal automatically updates every time you launch it through the `.bat`. While this is helpful if you often forget to pull updates, it may be inconvenient for some, so consider it optional.

### Cloning the Chapters

To run the ASTRAL DISC Chapters, you'll need to download a few mods and place them in the following directory:
```
C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\LOVE\ad\mods
```

> [!TIP]
> To find the `AppData` folder, press `Win + R`, type `%appdata%`, and hit Enter. Navigate to the `LOVE` folder, where you'll find the `ad` folder. Inside, you'll see `mods` and `saves` directories. Place all the following mods into the `mods` folder. 

- [Mod Loader](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/astraldisc)
- [Chapter 3](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter3)
- [Chapter 4](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter4)
- [Chapter 5](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter5)
- [Chapter 6](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter6)
- [Chapter 7](https://github.com/ASTRAL-DISC/chapter7)

This setup allows you to run the chapters by selecting them in the Chapter Selector.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It's necessary that you *clone* the aforementioned repositories to your computer instead of manually downloading their archives. This way, you can easily update your local copy of the mods by running `git pull` whenever updates are made.
